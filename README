This is a fork of Daisuke Murase's Perl module AnyEvent::JSONRPC::Lite.

CHANGES

The module is updated to support the format described by the JSONRPC version
2.0 specification. The relevant differences between jsonrpc 1.0 and 2.0 is the
support for batched method calls and named parameters by using a JSON Object
as 'parameters'.

Thinking about it batched operations might not be an optimization using TCP as
transport protocol and the named parameters part is really easy worked around.

INSTALLATION

AnyEvent::JSONRPC::Lite installation is straightforward. If your CPAN shell is set up,
you should just be able to do

    % cpan AnyEvent::JSONRPC::Lite

Download it, unpack it, then build it as per the usual:

    % perl Makefile.PL
    % make && make test

Then install it:

    % make install

DOCUMENTATION

AnyEvent::JSONRPC::Lite documentation is available as in POD. So you can do:

    % perldoc AnyEvent::JSONRPC::Lite

to read the documentation online with your favorite pager.
