This is a fork of Daisuke Murase's Perl module AnyEvent::JSONRPC::Lite.

CHANGES

This module is updated to use Yuval Kogman's JSON::RPC::Common for handling
the JSONRPC messages. This enables support for handling messages complying to
all versions of the JSONRPC standard.

The System Services/Service Description parts of version 1.1-wd and 1.1-alt is
unimplemented and left to users to implement.

The Batch processing parts of version 2.0 is unimplemented. It complicates the
code and doesn't makes much sense with plain TCP as transport layer. The
server is non-blocking and methods can make use of AnyEvent for enabling
multiplexing. 

INSTALLATION

AnyEvent::JSONRPC::Lite installation is straightforward. If your CPAN shell is set up,
you should just be able to do

    % cpan AnyEvent::JSONRPC::Lite

Download it, unpack it, then build it as per the usual:

    % perl Makefile.PL
    % make && make test

Then install it:

    % make install

DOCUMENTATION

AnyEvent::JSONRPC::Lite documentation is available as in POD. So you can do:

    % perldoc AnyEvent::JSONRPC::Lite

to read the documentation online with your favorite pager.
